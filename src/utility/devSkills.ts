I just knew this was what I had been looking for, and it truly solved the limitations I faced in C. Being a superset of C, C++ made coding feel much more intuitive and efficient.",

First, mastering React significantly levels up your capabilities in Next.js. Since React is primarily a UI library, learning it lays the foundation for working with Next.js, which adds powerful backend features on top—making the transition much smoother and more efficient. Second, React opens the door to app development with React Native. The concepts of state management and component logic are largely shared between the two, making it much easier to switch gears when you're ready to build mobile apps—which is something I’m actively looking forward to.",
