Since React is primarily a UI library, learning it lays the foundation for working with Next.js, which adds powerful backend features on topâ€”making the transition much smoother and more efficient. Second, React opens the door to app development with React Native. The concepts of state management and component logic are largely shared between the two, making it much easier to switch gears when you're ready to build mobile appsâ€”which is something Iâ€™m actively looking forward to.",
