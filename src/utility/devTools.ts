That’s because I don’t like to fully rely on AI to do my work. I want to be capable of doing everything on my own first, and only then, I may choose to use AI for the heavy lifting.", "But Perplexity is different from ChatGPT, which is why I started using it. In simple terms, ChatGPT works with the data it already has — nothing beyond that, pretty straightforward! Perplexity, on the other hand, is like a search engine + AI. It searches the web like Google, pulls in the latest information, and then uses AI to present the results. So now you know what to use and when… if you have the brains 😉"
