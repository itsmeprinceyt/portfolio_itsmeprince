I want to be capable of doing everything on my own first, and only then, I may choose to use AI for the heavy lifting.", "But Perplexity is different from ChatGPT, which is why I started using it. In simple terms, ChatGPT works with the data it already has â€” nothing beyond that, pretty straightforward! Perplexity, on the other hand, is like a search engine + AI. It searches the web like Google, pulls in the latest information, and then uses AI to present the results. So now you know what to use and whenâ€¦ if you have the brains ðŸ˜‰"
