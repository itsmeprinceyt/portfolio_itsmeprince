        description: "I used to make YouTube videos, and in the beginning, I had no idea how to create eye-catching thumbnails. I started out using MS Paint, then moved on to some online thumbnail makers. Eventually, I discovered Adobe Photoshop — and it changed everything. It's incredibly powerful — not just for thumbnails, but also for designing posters, UI/UX layouts, and much more.",

Photoshop was too heavy for my laptop, especially since I couldn’t always work on my PC. That’s when I tried Figma — and I quickly realized it’s like Photoshop but made specifically for designers. Since then, I’ve been using Figma regularly for all my UI/UX design needs.",

Eventually, I switched to Premiere Pro, and since it offered everything I was used to (and more), the transition was smooth without any issues.",
